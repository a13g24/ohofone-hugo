## General Impressions

I read this book because as any new(ish) parent, trying to communicate with your kids is a learning curve we all have 
to learn through trial and error, picking strategies up as we go. Because their language is underdeveloped, they lack 
the ability to map their internal state to a word, in order to then convey that to us adults trying to gain some 
understanding for their latest tantrum. 

I found Faber and Mazlish's book enlightening. Some of the principles—which I'll detail in the rest of this article—are 
insightful, others are fairly common sense. But overall, I felt that it arms parents with a series of strategies and
techniques to employ when they've ran out of things to try and ultimately failed to get through to their child.

The tricky part is employing the techniques. As with any self-help book, they require one to take note of what's been
learned and try to apply it consistently. I haven't succeeded as well in this respect, but I write this entry in hopes
that it'll serve as a guide and reminder to me (and hopefully to you as well) of what strategies are on-hand when 
communication breaks down.

All-in-all, underlying each strategy is empathy. One really needs to try to empathize with the child, understand their
distress, verbalize that understanding, and proceed with your solution in that headspace.
