## General Impressions

I read this book because as any new(ish) parent, trying to communicate with your kids is a learning curve we all have 
to learn through trial and error, picking strategies up as we go. Because their language is underdeveloped, they lack 
the ability to map their internal state to a word, in order to then convey that to us adults trying to gain some 
understanding for their latest tantrum. 

I found Faber and Mazlish's book enlightening. Some of the principles—which I'll detail in the rest of this article—are 
insightful, others are fairly common sense. But overall, I felt that it arms parents with a series of strategies and
techniques to employ when they've ran out of things to try and ultimately failed to get through to their child.

The tricky part is employing the techniques. As with any self-help book, they require one to take note of what's been
learned and try to apply it consistently. I haven't succeeded as well in this respect, but I write this entry in hopes
that it'll serve as a guide and reminder to me (and hopefully to you as well) of what strategies are on-hand when 
communication breaks down.

All-in-all, underlying each strategy is empathy. One really needs to try to empathize with the child, understand their
distress, verbalize that understanding, and proceed with your solution in that headspace.

## How to Engage Cooperation 

Trying to push away your child's feelings, to "put them in a better state" or dismiss them outright, will pretty much 
always backfire. A good strategy is to "prime" them for first accepting your help. To do this, one needs to empathize, 
and to do that, the authors give some nice suggestions:

1. Describe what you see or describe the problem. Like literally, describe what's the source of the problem without any
implied tone showcasing your feelings on the matter e.g. "I see the clothes are on the floor."
2. Give information. e.g. "Not feeding the dog means he gets really hungry.", "It really help if the clothes were in the
hamper."
3. Saying it with a single word. e.g. "Clothes!"
4. Talk about your feelings. In other words don't say what's wrong with them, but instead relate it back to you. e.g. 
"I get really frustrated and sad when I have to pick up all these clothes from the ground. It hurts my back."
5. Write a note. This can be as simple as a sticky note on an often forgotten task they fail to do. Or even writing it
in the fog of the mirror in the bathroom. So there's clever ways to do this.
