![Me](/img/me-about-small-3.jpg "Me") 


I'm Aaron, a software engineer and an all-around enthusiast for technology and learning. I have a deep passion for exploring new ideas, technologies, and concepts, and I love sharing my knowledge with others. Writing about my experiences and insights is something I truly enjoy, as it allows me to connect and engage with like-minded individuals.

Some things I love:
- Reading
- Writing
- Programming
- Playing and making music (guitar, piano, Bitwig)
- Exploring new places with my family
- Finding new restaurants
- Deep conversations

Thank you for visiting my blog! I hope you find something interesting and valuable here. If you have any questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to connect with fellow enthusiasts and learners. I've linked my email, GitHub, LinkedIn profile, and a discord server I've created to facilitate discussion in the footer. I look forward to connecting with you!
